# Interactive Album Covers
A library of code artworks. Inspired by my favourite albums. And ready to be downloaded and edited.

### Setup
I had to run all the cover using Jekyll, in order to avoid Cross Orgigin issues with WebGl and Three.js artworks.
So to have them all running without issues you should download and install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). [Here](https://jekyllrb.com/) you see the installing instructions (it's written in Ruby).
