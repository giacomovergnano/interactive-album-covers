 Reflection mapping an environment map onto a bumpy surface.

The surface is generated using a smothed grayscale voronoi pattern, from which we derive a height map and, using this, calculate the surface normal.

Moving your mouse up and down will change the smoothing parameter.
Moving your mouse left and right will change the bump amount.
